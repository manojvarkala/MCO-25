ID,Phase,Error_Summary,Technical_Root_Cause,Resolution_Applied
1,Asset Delivery,"Asset missing or server redirected to index.html",Single Page Application (SPA) routing on the web server intercepted fetch() requests to the plugin source directories,Switching to Vite Raw Asset Loading (?raw) to embed file content directly into the JavaScript bundle at build time.
2,Security,"Connection Blocked / CORS Failure",Browser blocked requests because the frontend and backend were on different domains and required credentialed handshakes,Updated apiFetch to use credentials: 'include' and ensured server-side CORS headers echoed the specific requesting origin.
3,Authentication,"Authorization Header Missing / 401 Unauthorized",Apache and LiteSpeed servers were stripping the HTTP Authorization header before it reached the WordPress REST API,Implemented a specific .htaccess rewrite rule to capture the header and pass it into an environment variable.
4,Authentication,"Security Key Mismatch / JWT Error",The MCO_JWT_SECRET in the WordPress backend did not match the key used to sign the token stored in the browser,Implemented a 'Hard Reset' function in the Login component to purge localStorage and force a fresh SSO handshake.
5,Data Management,"Google Sheets Access Restricted",Question datasets failed to load because the linked Google Sheet was not 'Published to Web' as a CSV,Updated the Test component to provide specific diagnostic messaging for private vs. invalid spreadsheet URLs.
6,Export/UI,"PDF Generation Missing Logos",html2canvas was unable to capture external logo images due to cross-origin security restrictions on the canvas,Added crossOrigin="anonymous" attributes to img tags and provided base64 encoded fallbacks in localLogos.ts.
7,Data Management,"Bulk CSV Import Failures",The PHP importer skipped rows or failed due to UTF-8 BOM markers and trailing empty commas in the source CSV,Added preg_replace logic to strip BOM markers and array_filter to validate row data integrity before processing.
8,Infrastructure,"tenant-config.json 404 on New Tenants",The React app crashed when pointed to a new domain before a configuration file existed in the /public directory,Developed the 'Tenant Blueprint Generator' tool in the WordPress plugin to scaffold valid empty configurations for new deployments.
9,UI/UX,"Race Condition: regionProfiles is not defined",A variable naming discrepancy between the local component state and the imported constants,Standardized naming conventions and implemented strict TypeScript interfaces to catch discrepancies at compile time.
10,Performance,"Visual Tabs Crash / Null Pointer",Admin customizers crashed when attempting to map over null or undefined exam objects returned by the API,Implemented nuclear defensive initialization in component state to provide virtual default objects if the backend data is incomplete.
11,Security,"Token Hijacking Vulnerability",Potential for session tokens to be intercepted if transmitted via insecure channels,Enforced HTTPS-only redirection and added a timestamp-based cache buster to all SSO redirect URLs.
12,Commerce,"Subscription Sync Lag",Users were unable to access premium content immediately after purchase due to server-side transient caching,Implemented an automated cache purging hook (mco_invalidate_app_cache_on_save) that clears transients on WooCommerce order completion.
