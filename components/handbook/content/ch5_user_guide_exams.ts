    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">5.1 The Exam Player Interface</h3>
    <p>Our exam player is designed to be clean and intuitive, allowing you to focus on the questions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Timer & Progress Bar:</strong> The timer is always visible at the top, showing your remaining time. The progress bar below it gives you a visual cue of how far you are from the end.</li>
        <li><strong>Question Navigation:</strong> You can move between questions using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons, or jump directly to any question using the navigator grid on the left. Answered questions will be highlighted in the grid.</li>
        <li><strong>Submitting:</strong> Once you've answered all questions, click the "Submit" button. If you have unanswered questions, you will be asked to confirm before submitting. If the timer runs out, your test will be submitted automatically.</li>
    </ul>

        <p class="font-bold text-red-800">Important: Proctoring Rules</p>
        <p class="text-red-700">For official certification exams, browser-based proctoring is enabled. You must remain in <strong>fullscreen mode</strong> and <strong>on the exam tab</strong> at all times. Leaving fullscreen or switching tabs is a "violation." You will receive a warning, and after 3 violations, your exam will be automatically terminated.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">5.2 The Results Page: A Detailed Breakdown</h3>
    <p>After submitting, you'll see a brief processing animation before being taken to your detailed Results page.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your Score:</strong> Your final score, pass/fail status, and a breakdown of correct vs. incorrect answers are displayed prominently.</li>
        <li><strong>Answer Review (Practice Exams Only):</strong> For practice tests, you can expand each question to review your answer against the correct one. To protect the integrity of the official exams, this feature is not available for paid certification tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate Your Experience:</strong> After each exam, you can leave a star rating and a review. This helps us and other users! Your ratings will appear on the exam cards on the main website.</li>
        <li><strong>Share Your Achievement:</strong> If you pass, you can download a pre-formatted image of your result to share on social media platforms like LinkedIn.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">5.3 Premium Features on the Results Page</h3>
    <p>Passing a certification exam or having an active subscription unlocks powerful features on the results page.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI-Powered Feedback:</strong> This premium feature generates a personalized PDF study guide based on your incorrect answers. Access is unlocked for subscribers on any failed exam, or for users who have purchased an exam or bundle.</li>
        <li><strong>Downloadable Certificate:</strong> If you pass a paid certification exam, a button will appear to "Download Your Certificate". If your exam had proctoring violations, you will see a "Provisional Pass" notice, and your certificate will be issued within 24 hours after a brief integrity review.</li>
    </ul>
