    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">1.1 The Vision: Professional Coding Proficiency</h3>
    <p>The Medical Coding industry is defined by precision, evolving standards, and high-stakes certification. The Annapoorna Examination Engine was built to meet these demands, providing a robust ecosystem for students preparing for **AAPC** and **AHIMA** credentials.</p>
    <p>Our vision is to provide the most realistic simulation of the **CPC (Certified Professional Coder)**, **CIC**, and **COC** exams. This platform goes beyond simple multiple-choice questions by integrating AI-powered feedback that understands the nuances of the CPT, ICD-10-CM, and HCPCS Level II code sets.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">1.2 Why Headless for Coding Educators?</h3>
    <p>For coding schools and independent instructors, the "headless" architecture offers unique benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Code Set Updates:</strong> Reflect annual code set updates across your entire network of portals by updating a single Google Sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenario-Based Speed:</strong> Render complex medical case studies and procedural notes instantly with our high-performance React frontend.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrated Study Hall:</strong> Seamlessly connect students to the latest official code books and study guides through our geo-targeted affiliate bookstore.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">1.3 Empowering the Next Generation of Coders</h3>
    <p>This engine is a comprehensive business and educational solution. It automates the "busy work" of administration—certificate issuance, proctoring, and marketing—so you can focus on mentorship and teaching the complex logic of medical necessity and documentation.</p>
