    <p>The <code>mco-exam-integration-engine</code> plugin provides several shortcodes to seamlessly integrate the headless React application with your public-facing WordPress site.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">15.1 The Login Shortcode: <code>[mco_exam_login]</code></h3>
    <p>This shortcode is the key to the Single Sign-On (SSO) experience.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To securely transition a logged-in WordPress user into the React application.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Create a new page in WordPress with the slug <code>exam-login</code> (or any slug you prefer). Place only this shortcode on the page.</li>
        <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> When a user visits this page, the shortcode checks if they are logged into WordPress. If they are, it generates a JWT and redirects them to the React app with the token. If they are not, it redirects them to the standard WordPress login screen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">15.2 The Showcase Shortcode: <code>[mco_exam_showcase]</code></h3>
    <p>This shortcode allows you to embed beautifully styled, dynamic "exam cards" directly into any page or post on your WordPress site.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To create a sales or information page on your main site that links directly to the exam programs in the React app or adds products to the WooCommerce cart.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1">
                <li><code>[mco_exam_showcase]</code>: Use without any attributes to display a grid of all your published exam programs.</li>
                <li><code>[mco_exam_showcase id="prod-12345"]</code>: Use with the <code>id</code> attribute (using the app's program ID, e.g., "prod-...") to display only a single, specific exam program.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> The shortcode fetches live data from your Exam Programs and WooCommerce products to display up-to-date titles, descriptions, pricing, and "Add to Cart" links.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">15.3 The Book Showcase Shortcode: <code>[mco_book_showcase]</code></h3>
    <p>Similar to the exam showcase, this shortcode embeds a grid of your recommended books onto any page.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To create a "Book Store" or "Resources" page on your main website.</li>
        <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> It displays each book with its cover (either from a URL or procedurally generated), description, and geo-targeted affiliate links for Amazon.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">15.4 Standalone Purchase Notifier Script</h3>
    <p>For added social proof on your main sales pages, the in-app admin panel provides a standalone HTML/JavaScript snippet for the "Live Purchase Notifier."</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> In the React app, navigate to <strong>Admin → Integration → WooCommerce Styling & Scripts</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Copy the provided HTML code block. In your WordPress admin, you can paste this into a "Custom HTML" widget in your site's footer, or use a plugin that allows you to inject scripts into your site's footer.</li>
        <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> This script is self-contained and has no dependencies. It will create a small pop-up that displays fake, randomized purchase data, creating a sense of activity and encouraging new visitors to buy.</li>
    </ul>
